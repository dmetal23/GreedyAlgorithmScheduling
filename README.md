Machine Scheduling with Deadlines to Minimize the Sum of Lateness

##Project Description Task: 
Task: Recall the 1 machine scheduling with deadlines problem where the goal was to minimize the sum of the latenesses of the jobs. 

You are to write a program to solve instances of this problem. 

The input will be provided to your program in a text file called jobs.txt. Each line of this file will contain 2 numbers separated by whitespace. The two numbers will represent the processing time and deadline of each job.

Reminders: In class we discussed the problem, proved several natural greedy algorithms failed, and outlined one inefficient algorithm for the problem. 

**Sample Interaction:** 

Project 1: 1 Machine Scheduling with Deadlines to Minimize the Sum of Lateness
Reading jobs.txt
The best order to schedule the jobs is:
3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 6, 5
It has a total lateness of 21.
